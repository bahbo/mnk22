File Manager is a graphical file manager for Linux. The main interface consists of two panels which display the file system. 

*Navigation:*
 - The active panel can be identified by the highlighted bar in the directory listing, which can be moved up and down with the arrow keys.
 - Users can switch between panels using <TAB> key.
 - <Enter> key is used for selecting directory or opening a document using its default application.   
 - Function keys perform operations such as renaming, deleting and copying files.
 - Keyboard shortcuts: Cut - <Ctrl+X>, Copy - <Ctrl+C>, Paste - <Ctrl+V> .
 
All elements of the File Manager can be accessed using mouse clicks as well. 

The bottom row shows all functionality available for easier accessibility. The buttons' functions are fairly self-explanatory.
