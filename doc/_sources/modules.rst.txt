Structure
============
This project tries to implement model-view-presenter design pattern.

 - View module provides the visualization of the data.  

 - Model module is responsible for handling the application logic.

 - Presenter module acts upon the Model and the View. It retrieves data from the Model, and formats it for display in the View.
